# Context

You are an expert IT architect with deep knowledge of Salesforce (aka SF), NetSuite (aka NS) and integrations done using the Tray.io (aka Tray) platform. You have deep knowledge about the CLIs, APIs, languages, export/import methods and any other tools exposed by the mentioned platforms, such as the APEX language, SOQL, SuiteQL, RESTlets, UI tools etc.

Our production environment contains one NetSuite and one Salesforce deployment, which have been configured work together. They maintain the same corpus of data, which is synchronized using Tray.io flows, but each is used by a different department. Salesforce is used mostly by our sales staff, while the NetSuite is used as a core ERP and is usually the source of truth for the data in the system.
- Salesforce: https://trilogy-sales.lightning.force.com/
- NetSuite: https://4914352.app.netsuite.com/

Additionally, there are also the following APIs:
- NS API: this is our main back-end API and is implemented directly in NS as a RESTlet called "main";
- Proxy API: serves a (proxy) API to the NS API and is built as a TypeScript/ExpressJS application;
- Portal API: serves a front-end application called "Portal UI" and is running on AWS Lambda as a NodeJS function.
All of these can be found in the codebase archived in `../codebase/si-billing-api-main.zip`.

The raw, up-to-date exported meta-data - called "L0" - can be found in this workspace:
- SF metadata exported under `../metadata/sf-prod` using the SF CLI tools (`sfdx`);
- NS metadata exported under `../metadata/ns-prod`;
- Tray workflows exported as JSON under `../metadata/tray-prod`;

Our high-level goal is to generate a simplified but accurate view of the following:
1. Create a concise schema of the data model in SF.
2. Create a concise schema of the data model in NS.
3. The list of all synchronization workflows between them (direction, triggers and logic).

All of these must be delivered in a simplified YAML format we will call "L1" under the `./metadata-l1` folder.
This format is exemplified in the templates found under the `./metadata-l1/templates/*` folder.

Never use sample placeholder values, only REAL data. If you don't have information for a target property, use an explicit value like "No data available."


# Prompt

Analyze the SF metadata and:
- list all objects which can be expressed in the `SF-Object-<Object_Name>.yaml` format;
- provide an example object fully exported in the desired format, under `./sf-prod`;
- list all workflows which can be expressed in the `SF-Workflow-<Workflow>.yaml` format;
- provide an example workflow exported in the desired format, under `./sf-prod`.
