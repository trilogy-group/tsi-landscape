        This is a technical field that fuels the "Incoming Not Distributed"
        referral list view. The idea is that all incoming referrals are created
        and owned by the integration user, but when they are distributed—the
        owner is changed to some AE who takes it over, making the formula
        expression FALSE. See the "Incoming Flow" section of the user guide for
        more details.
