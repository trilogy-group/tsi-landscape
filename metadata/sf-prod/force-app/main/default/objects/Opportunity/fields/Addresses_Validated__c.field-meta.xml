    <inlineHelpText>Make sure you verify the customer and partner (if applicable) addresses. Check this box when done. You can&apos;t generate the final quote until you verify. If sold directly, set both shipping and billing addresses on the account. If sold via a partner, set the shipping address for the end-user on the account, and billing address on the partner (since we will be charging them).</inlineHelpText>
